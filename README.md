# Predicting-House-Prices-with-ML
This project aims to build a machine learning model to house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bathrooms, and total square feet area. The project walks through data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, and model building using multiple algorithms to select the best-performing model.
